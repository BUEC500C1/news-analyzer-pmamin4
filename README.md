The folders: "Up_API", "nn2", and "API_practice" contain the upload, news analysis, and text sentiment analysis of my api resectively.

I made some mistakes when doing the text-sentiment analysis and the news analysis portions of the api and will still be making updates on them. 

I encorportated Flask, mongodb and pymongo. The results from three seperate APIs are shown in the image files
